# Python for Astronomy

The talk slides are [here](und-2018-04-06.pdf).

## Install Python

All of the packages below should work with any Python distribution.

However, they are all easiest to install if you use the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). An alternative (and much smaller to download) is the [miniconda installer](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), which is the Anaconda distribution without several pre-installed packages.

## Overview of astropy and affiliated packages

For astropy, see this [recent paper about astropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02634)

For an overview of the affiliated packages, see [this blog post](https://www.numfocus.org/uncategorized/leveling-up-with-open-astronomy-astropy-affiliated-packages)
